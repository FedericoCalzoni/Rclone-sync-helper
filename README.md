# Rclone-sync-helper
RClone Sync Helper is a simple project that helps you automate your rclone syncs. It consists of two scripts: sync.sh and folders.sh. The scripts can be run from the terminal, and can be set up to start automatically. If set up for automatic start, a small pop-up will be displayed to ask for confirmation before syncing.
